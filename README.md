# Electronics-Pack

A simple electrical distribution box made for Voron 2.4 with the purpose of making rear connections neater especially when using tool changers. 


## Introduction

On my 2.4 I have/will have running to the rear top of the printer:
  1. Rear exhaust fan
  2. LED Lights
  3. CANBUS + Power cable
  4. VOC Scrubber

I thought it would be a good opportunity to reuse the XY cable chains that came with my 2.4 kit which was made redundent when I moved to CANBUS. 
Currently this is designed for a Voron 2.4 350mm in mind.
